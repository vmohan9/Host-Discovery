# Host-Discovery
This is a trusted host discovery program which crawls for host names in various following locations of the system :
/etc/hosts
~/.ssh/config for each user and /etc/ssh/ssh_config
~/.ssh/authorized_keys for each user
~/.ssh/known_hosts for each user and /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts

The program handles permissions efficiently without any crash.
